This directory contains benchmarks for regression verification
created from Linux device drivers
and specifications from the Linux Driver Verification center
(http://linuxtesting.org/project/ldv).

A description of the benchmarks can be found here:

The benchmarks were taken from commit e6ec5e0 of the repository
https://bitbucket.org/dbeyer/regressionverificationtasks

Each directory contains verification tasks created from one driver
for several specifications and in several revisions.
